.SH LIST VARIABLES
\fIEPM\fR maintains a list of variables and their values which can be used to substitute values in the list file.
These variables are imported from the current environment and taken from the command-line and list file as provided.
Substitutions occur when the variable name is referenced with the dollar sign ($):
.nf
.br

    %postinstall <<EOF
    echo What is your name:
    read $$name
    Your name is $$name
    EOF

    f 0555 root sys ${bindir}/foo foo
    f 0555 root sys $datadir/foo/foo.dat foo.dat
.fi
.LP
Variable names can be surrounded by curley brackets (${name}) or alone ($name); without brackets the name is terminated by the first slash (/), dash (-), or whitespace.
The dollar sign can be inserted using $$.
