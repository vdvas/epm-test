.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR epm (1)
generates software packages complete with installation, removal, and (if necessary) patch scripts.
Unless otherwise specified, the files required for \fIproduct\fR are read from a file named "\fIproduct\fR.list".
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized:
.TP 5
\fB\-a \fIarchitecture\fR
Specifies the actual architecture for the software.
Without this option the generic processor architecture is used ("intel", "sparc", "mips", etc.)
.TP 5
\fB\-f aix\fR
Generate an AIX distribution suitable for installation on an AIX system.
.TP 5
\fB\-f bsd\fR
Generate a BSD distribution suitable for installation on a FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD system.
.TP 5
\fB\-f deb\fR
Generate a Debian distribution suitable for installation on a Debian Linux system.
.TP 5
\fB\-f inst\fR
.TP 5
\fB\-f tardist\fR
Generate an IRIX distribution suitable for installation on an system running IRIX.
.TP 5
\fB\-f lsb\fR
.TP 5
\fB\-f lsb\-signed\fR
Generate RPM packages for LSB-conforming systems.
The \fIlsb\-signed\fR format uses the GPG private key you have defined in the ~/.rpmmacros file.
.TP 5
\fB\-f native\fR
Generate a native distribution.
This uses \fIrpm\fR for Linux, \fIinst\fR for IRIX, \fIpkg\fR for Solaris, \fIswinstall\fR for HP-UX, \fIbsd\fR for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and \fIosx\fR for macOS.
All other operating systems default to the \fIportable\fR format.
.TP 5
\fB\-f macos\fR
.TP 5
\fB\-f macos\-signed\fR
Generate a macOS software package.
The \fImacos\-signed\fR format uses the signing identity in the EPM_SIGNING_IDENTITY environment variable.
.TP 5
\fB\-f pkg\fR
Generate an AT&T software package.
These are used primarily under Solaris.
.TP 5
\fB\-f portable\fR
Generate a portable distribution based on shell scripts and tar files.
The resulting distribution is installed and removed the same way on all operating systems. [default]
.TP 5
\fB\-f rpm\fR
.TP 5
\fB\-f rpm\-signed\fR
Generate a Red Hat Package Manager ("RPM") distribution suitable for installation on a Red Hat Linux system.
The \fIrpm\-signed\fR format uses the GPG private key you have defined in the ~/.rpmmacros file.
.TP 5
\fB\-f setld\fR
Generate a Tru64 (setld) software distribution.
.TP 5
\fB\-f slackware\fR
Generate a Slackware Linux software distribution.
.TP 5
\fB\-f swinstall\fR
.TP 5
\fB\-f depot\fR
Generate a HP-UX software distribution.
.TP 5
\fB\-g\fR
Disable stripping of executable files in the distribution.
.TP 5
\fB\-k\fR
Keep intermediate (spec, etc.) files used to create the distribution in the distribution directory.
.TP 5
\fB\-m \fIname\fR
Specifies the platform name as a string.
The default is to use the auto-generated name from the \fI\-n\fR option.
.TP 5
\fB\-n\fR[\fImrs\fR]
Specifies the operating system and machine information that is included in the package name.
Distributions normally are named "product-version-system-release-machine.ext" and "product-version-system-release-machine-patch.ext" for patch distributions.
The "system-release-machine" information can be customized or eliminated using the appropriate trailing letters.
Using \fI-n\fR by itself will remove the "system-release-machine" string from the filename entirely.
The letter 'm' includes the architecture (machine).
The letter 'r' includes the operating system version (release).
The letter 's' includes the operating system name.
.TP 5
\fB\-s \fIsetup.ext\fR
.TP 5
\fB\-v\fR

The default directory is based on the operating system, version, and architecture.
.TP 5
\fB\-\-setup\-image \fIsetup.ext\fR

This option is currently only supported by portable distributions.
.TP 5
\fB\-\-setup\-program \fI/foo/bar/setup\fR
Specifies the setup executable to use with the distribution.
This option is currently only supported by portable distributions.
